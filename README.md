# Home Assistant Omada Add-On
This add-on brings the Omada Controller directly into Home Assistant. 

The Controller version is 5.9.31 and the specifity of this add-on are especially made for my needs though.

# About this Add-On
This add-on is a fork of jkunczik [home-assistant-omada](https://github.com/jkunczik/home-assistant-omada). Thanks to him! 

This add-on is also based on Matt Bentleys work [docker-omada-cotroller](https://github.com/mbentley/docker-omada-controller). This would not have been possible without his excellent work. Other than in the original docker omada controller, this add-on stores all persistent data in the /data directory, so that it is compatible with Home assistant.
